### Changes to BNF:

1. Removed all uneeded and inseparable add_on, component grammar. Just made it simple and not repetetive:
<component> ::= <component_name>
<add_on> ::= <add_on_name> " " <price> "eur"

2. Added "%" to <discaout> to make it unique.

3. Moved "eur" from <boardgame> and <add_on> to <price> for clarity

4. Moved <quantity> from <components> to <component>, added missing <add_on> to <product>.

5. 
   - Deleted <add_ons>, <components>, and moved <add_on>, <component> to <product>. To avoid code repetition for recursive elements.
   - Separated <boardgame> to two for clarity:
     <boardgame> ::=  <boardgame_name> " " <price>  " (contains: " <products> ")"
     <boardgame_with_addons> ::= <boardgame> "[includes: " <products> "]"

6. Added <total_command>

#### NOTE:
   The changes to BNF were made because there either were mistakes or for clarity, simplicity purposes. The main logic hasn't been changed. The examples up above are still valid.
